RexPro client in F#
---

Just created this repo. More information on how to use the client is coming very soon.
For now take a look at Testing.fsx for simple use of the client.
There is also a bunch of stuff I am going to improve/add.

##### TODO:
- Better connection pooling
- Editable properties for connection pool settings
- Cleaner code within client.fs (seperate some logic etc.)
- Transaction support
- +++

Please clone and do whatever you want with this code, but please share.
